A fullstack Java developer is proficient in utilizing Java frameworks such as Spring for backend server-side development, which includes handling data storage, business logic, and API integrations. On the frontend, Java can be employed in various ways, such as with frameworks like Vaadin or JavaFX for building user interfaces, or integrating with JavaScript frameworks like Angular or React through tools like JHipster. This approach enables developers to leverage Java's robustness, scalability, and ecosystem to create cohesive, efficient, and maintainable web applications that span from server-side operations to client-side user experiences. Fullstack Java developers typically possess a broad skill set encompassing database management, server configuration, API design, and responsive frontend design, making them versatile contributors to modern web development projects..></p>
